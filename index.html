					<h2>2011 - Boxster E Research Project Introduced</h2>
					<p>With the “Boxster E” lab vehicle, Porsche Engineering demonstrated its deep and diverse experience in the field of electromobility. The purely electric powertrain has two electric motors with up to 180 kW of output and a high-voltage battery for 240 kW. That makes for typical sports car-type performance. The central battery management system secures the system and can handle rapid charges taking less than 30 minutes. These are all the fruits of Porsche Engineering's wealth of electromobility experience.</p>

					<p>An important milestone in Ferdinand Porsche’s career came in 1906. At a mere 31 years of age, he assumed the position of the Technical Director at Austro Daimler in Wiener Neustadt and was in charge of products from one of Europe's leading automobile companies. The “Prince Henry Car” that led the Austro-Daimler plant team to finish in the top three at the widely known Prince Henry Trials was among the greatest achievements of this time. With Austro-Daimler’s “Sascha” model, he developed a small racing car that prevailed in the Targa Florio race in 1922 against competition with a greater engine capacity and notched up no less than 43 race victories.</p>
